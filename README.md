An ergonomic, minimal, and fully-featured keymap for the **Chocofi 36-key split keyboard** (RP2040).  
Built on the principles of [Miryoku](https://github.com/manna-harbour/miryoku) — efficiency, symmetry, and minimal finger movement.

## 🤔 Why this repo exists

This repository provides a ready-to-use Miryoku layout for the Chocofi 36-key split keyboard, built on ZMK and fully compatible with the Keymap Editor.

It removes the need to manually adapt Miryoku’s QMK or ZMK templates and makes customization accessible through a visual editor, while staying 100% faithful to the original Miryoku philosophy and structure.
